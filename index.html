<h1>Book Collector</h1>
<p><pre>Book collector helps you to keep track of all the books your read over the years.
    It helps you capture ratings about books you liked (or didn't like), and will even suggest
    new books based on the books you already read.
    The best thing? Each book you read will get you closer to the best possible recommendation. </pre></p>
