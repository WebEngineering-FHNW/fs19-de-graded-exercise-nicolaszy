            <p>
                Welcome to Book Collector. Book Collector lets you record all the books you've
                read over the years, and (of course) recommends new books that might interest you
                going forward. You can then look through your recommendations and add books to your
                library that you want to read. </br>
                Also, Book Collector lets you rate books and look at their cover and further details,
                based only on the isbn.
            </p>
