## Commit Proposal

Matriculation Number: 16-967-804

Project idea short description: 
Organise your personal book collection by 
saving the isbn and a rating for each book. 
The data is saved in a local database (with the 
user who saved it). The goodreads api will then 
provide a title as well as author and the book cover. 
Then, the aim would be to give the user a number of new
book suggestions he might like, based on books that 
have already been rated by the user. 

Features: 
-book collection containing ISBN, user and rating 
-sorted overview over favorite books, containing 
their title (based on the isbn, using goodreads api)
-possibility to log in as a user 
-possibility to save a book ISBN 
-possibility to rate the book once read 

More features (will be added if I have enough time):
-book cover, author and more information 
-suggestions on what book I could read next, 
based on information about books I liked
